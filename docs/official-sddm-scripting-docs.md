## Scripting in SQL Developer Data Modeler

The scripting capabilities within SQL Developer Data Modeler (SDDM) represent a powerful means of reporting on the details of the models defined within SDDM.

The official documentation of the scripting capabilities can be found in the SDDM installation files which have a slightly different location based on which installation of SDDM is being used.

Embedded version: `<INSTALL_DIR>/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper/extensions/oracle.datamodeler/xmlmetadata/doc`
Stand-alone version: `<INSTALL_DIR>/datamodeler/datamodeler/xmlmetadata/doc`

Within this directory there are 2 files of interest:

 1. *SQLDeveloperDataModelerScripting.docx* ontains an overview of scripting in Data Modeler. While it does contain some useful information, it is far from comprehensive, and to be honest, reads more like a set of notes than product documentation.
 2. *index.html* file is an HTML document describing the properties of the objects that are accessible using scripting.

For more information on index.html, and Data Modeler scripting please see my blog series on [Scripting in Oracle SqL Developer Data Modeler](https://daveschleis.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/data-modeler-scripting-101-lets-start-at-the-very-beginning/)
